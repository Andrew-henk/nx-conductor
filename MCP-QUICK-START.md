# 🚀 Claude Session Intelligence - Quick Start

## Fixed and Ready to Use!

Both packages are now published and fully functional:

### 📦 **Published Packages**

- **MCP Server**: `claude-session-intelligence-mcp@1.0.2` ✅ **FIXED**
- **NX Plugin**: `nx-claude-sessions-intelligence@1.2.0` ✅ **Working**

---

## 🛠️ **Installation**

### Option 1: Complete Setup (NX + MCP)
```bash
# For NX users - get both intelligent sessions AND universal MCP access
npm install -D nx-claude-sessions-intelligence
npm install -g claude-session-intelligence-mcp@latest

# Initialize in your NX workspace
npx nx g nx-claude-sessions-intelligence:init
```

### Option 2: MCP Server Only
```bash
# For any project - universal intelligence via MCP
npm install -g claude-session-intelligence-mcp@latest
```

---

## 🧠 **What You Get**

### **Persistent Intelligence**
- **Before**: "Let me explain our auth system again..."
- **After**: "I see you use JWT with 15min expiry because of your scaling requirements..."

### **Decision Storage** 
- Every architectural choice recorded with full reasoning
- Searchable across all libraries and sessions
- No more contradictory implementations

### **Pattern Recognition**
- Reusable solutions automatically captured
- Applied consistently across your codebase
- Accelerated development with proven approaches

---

## 🎯 **Quick Test**

### Test MCP Server Installation
```bash
# Should show binary location (not crash)
which claude-session-intelligence-mcp

# Should start without module errors
echo "test" | claude-session-intelligence-mcp &
sleep 1
killall claude-session-intelligence-mcp
echo "✅ MCP Server working!"
```

### Test in Claude Code Session
```bash
# After configuring Claude Desktop (see full setup below)
# You can use these commands in ANY Claude Code session:
```

**In Claude Chat:**
```
Load context for my auth library
```
```
What JWT decisions were made previously?
```
```
Show me authentication patterns I can reuse
```
```
Record this decision: We're using OAuth with PKCE flow because it's more secure for SPAs than implicit flow
```

---

## 🔧 **Claude Desktop Configuration**

Add to your `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claude-session-intelligence": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["claude-session-intelligence-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "WORKSPACE_ROOT": "/path/to/your/workspace"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Then restart Claude Desktop.**

---

## 📁 **How It Works**

Each library gets a `.claude/` directory that accumulates intelligence:

```
libs/my-auth-lib/
├── src/
└── .claude/
    ├── decisions.json      # "Why we chose JWT over sessions"
    ├── patterns.json       # "Reusable auth guard pattern"
    ├── context.md         # "Library domain knowledge" 
    └── session-history.json # "Key learnings from past work"
```

### **Available MCP Tools**

- `record_decision` - Capture architectural choices with reasoning
- `search_decisions` - Find previous decisions across all libraries
- `get_library_context` - Load complete accumulated knowledge
- `get_patterns` - Access proven code patterns
- `record_pattern` - Save reusable solutions

## 🎉 **Example Session**

### **First Session (Building Intelligence)**
```
User: I need to implement JWT authentication
Claude: I'll help you implement JWT authentication and capture our architectural decisions for future sessions.

[Implements JWT solution]

Claude: I've recorded this decision:
- **Decision**: JWT with 15-minute expiry + refresh tokens
- **Reasoning**: Stateless auth for microservices, better scalability  
- **Pattern**: Custom JWT guard with automatic user injection
```

### **Future Sessions (Using Intelligence)**
```
User: I need to add OAuth to the existing auth
Claude: I can see your existing JWT infrastructure with 15-minute tokens and refresh mechanism. I'll integrate OAuth to work with your established patterns...

[Builds on existing decisions instead of starting fresh]
```
